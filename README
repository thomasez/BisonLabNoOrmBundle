A Nosql Bundle for Symfony 2. 

Author: Thomas Lundquist <thomasez@redpill-linpro.com>

Project started june 2011. 


This is yet another way to access MongoDB (for now) in Symfony 2 and was
created because of the disliking of the concept of the Doctrine ODM.

This is way smaller, simpler and definately not enterprisey but seems to 
work on schema less databases. 

The concept is to use MongoDB for storage of array objects with as little
work as possible to maintain the arrays.

Documentation can be found in  Resources/doc/index.rst

-- more will arrive in this README later
